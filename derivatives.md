## Valuation of Contigent Claims

### Introduction 

* Main goal is to understand how the values of options are determined 
* Like other instruments, a valuation model is used with inputs and an ouput. This also follows the no arbitrage principle.
* Thus the approximate price of an option is one that makes it impossible for any party to earn an arbitrage profit at the expense of the other
* This price is the value of the option 

2 models : 

    1. Binomial model : based on discrete time
    2. BSM model : based on continuous time 

* From the perspective of abitrageur : Do not use own money, Do not take price risk 
* Built on the law of one price - if 2 investments have same CF, then both should have same current price 

A few assumptions are made : 

    1. Instruments are identifiale and investible
    2. There are not market frictions : transaction costs, taxes
    3. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds
    4. Underlying instrument follows a known stat distribution
    5. Borrowing and lending at a risk free rate is available
