### Introduction to Growth in the Global Economy 

How does econ affect?

* Future econ activity affects --> expected future stream of earnings affects --> stock market valuation
* Expected long-run growth rate of real income affects --> average interest rate in the country --> real returns 
* In shorter term, relation b/w actual and potential growth --> fixed income returns 

Over long periods, Actual growth rate of **GDP** = rate of increase in **Potential GPD** 

Developed vs Developing nations 

* Measured using annual change in real GDP or real per-capita GDP - growth ==> improving std. of living 
* To compare 2 country's GDP, we need a common currency - generally the $ is used - but for conversion, we should not use the market exchange rate, rather the rate determined by PPP should be used. 

### 1. Factors for and against econ growth

#### 1. Financial Markets and Intermediaries

Viscious cycle in developing nations : 

    * Low savings --> low investments --> slow down of GDP --> low income --> low savings

Can break free using foreign investments

Apart from savings rate, how efficiently it is allocated also matters. Financial industry plays a major role in this aspect. 

3 ways for fin institutions to promote growth : 

    1. By allocating savings to projects that are likely to generate the highest risk-adjusted returns
    2. By creating attractive investment instruments that help with risk transfer, diversification and promote liquidity. 
    3. Well developed fin markets can help with credit constraints faced by businesses

However, if financial markets cause declining credit stds and/or increasing leverage, then it increases risk

#### 2. Political Stability, Rule of law and Property rights

Stable and effective govt, well-developed legal system and respect for property rights : ***key for econ growth***

Clearly established property rights incentivises households and cos to save and invest + legal system to protect these laws. War and other political instability increases risk and discourages foreign investment.

#### 3. Education and Health Care Systems 

Inadequate education ==> Unskilled workers. Deving countries also face brain drain. Better education ==> Increase in productivity of existing physical capital 

Good healthcare is important for healty workers and improving life expectancy

#### 4. Tax and Regulatory Systems

Limited regulation ==> encourages entrepreneurial activity and new companies. Strong correlation b/w entry of new companies and average productivity levels

#### 5. Free and Unrestricted Capital Flows 

Foreign investment can take place in 2 ways : 

    1. FDI - Foreign direct investments - eg. buying ppe in country
    2. Foreign investors investing in securities of local companies

International trade and low tariffs allow locals to get good quality products for cheap. It increases local vedor's competition but also give them access to braoder markets 

### 2. Why potential growth matters to investors  

Both equity and bonds depend on growth rate of econ activity. Potential GDP - max amount of o/p that an econ can produce without causing inflation

In the long run, real earnings growth cannot exceed the growth rate of potential GDP

Grinold-Kroner decomposition of ROE 

> ROE = Div. yield (dy) + ***expected capital gain***
      = div yield + expected repricing + ***EPS growth***
      = dev yield + expected repricing + inflation rate + real econ growth - change in outstanding shares

$$ ROE = dy + \delta P/E + i + g - \delta S$$

* dy has been fairly stable over time and a significant contributor to equity market returns 
* Delta P/E is the change in PE ratios in the market - with increasing GDP growth rates, P/E ratios trend higher as investors view the econ to be less risky and are willing to pay more. But the major stuff that affects is the PE cycle due to market volatility
* Delta S is the dilution factor. Companies buyback / issue shares which changes dilution. Also, SMEs are not listed and they contribute to the econ - thus the expanded delta S = nbb + rd; nbb : net buybacks and rd : relative dynamism of the econ

Potential GDP growth affects the bond prices : 

    1. Higher rate of potential GDP ==> increased credit quality of bonds. Slower rate ==> raises percieved risk of bonds
    2. Monetary policy decision are affected by diff b/w econ's estimated potential o/p and actual operating level (called o/p gap) and also using actual GDP growth vs long-term sustainable growth rate
    3. Govt budget deficits increase during recessions and decrease during expansions - when judging fiscal policy, it is done wrt a cyclically adjusted deficit

Say for example if the GDP growth forecasted for the next year is 1.5% and the long-term potential GDP growth is 3.25%. 

* Here, the forecasted GDP growth << long-term potential GDP 
* ==> an growing o/p gap / slack
* ==> places downward pressure on inflation reduce inflation expectations
* ==> central bank will step in to reduce interest rates
* ==> Bond prices will rise 

### 3. Production Function and Growth Accounting 

* Production function is a model of link b/w inputs (factors of production), technology and output. 

> 2 factor prod function : Y = AF(K,L) : 
K - capital used to produce, 
L - qty of labor, no of hours, 
F - function, 
A - A multiplicative scale called TFP - total factor productivity. Indicates general level of productivity or ***technology*** in the society

Cobb-Douglas production function
