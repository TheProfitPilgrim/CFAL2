### Introduction to Growth in the Global Economy 

How does econ affect?

* Future econ activity affects --> expected future stream of earnings affects --> stock market valuation
* Expected long-run growth rate of real income affects --> average interest rate in the country --> real returns 
* In shorter term, relation b/w actual and potential growth --> fixed income returns 

Over long periods, Actual growth rate of **GDP** = rate of increase in **Potential GPD** 

Developed vs Developing nations 

* Measured using annual change in real GDP or real per-capita GDP - growth ==> improving std. of living 
* To compare 2 country's GDP, we need a common currency - generally the $ is used - but for conversion, we should not use the market exchange rate, rather the rate determined by PPP should be used. 

### 1. Factors for and against econ growth

#### 1. Financial Markets and Intermediaries

Viscious cycle in developing nations : 

    * Low savings --> low investments --> slow down of GDP --> low income --> low savings

Can break free using foreign investments

Apart from savings rate, how efficiently it is allocated also matters. Financial industry plays a major role in this aspect. 

3 ways for fin institutions to promote growth : 

    1. By allocating savings to projects that are likely to generate the highest risk-adjusted returns
    2. By creating attractive investment instruments that help with risk transfer, diversification and promote liquidity. 
    3. Well developed fin markets can help with credit constraints faced by businesses

However, if financial markets cause declining credit stds and/or increasing leverage, then it increases risk

#### 2. Political Stability, Rule of law and Property rights
